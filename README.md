# T4R - *The Traveller's Tales Texture Ripper*
Rudimentary texture ripper for TT Lego Games

---

<table><tbody><tr><td>
  <strong>Note:</strong> You will have to extract the game files first with a program like <a href="https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm">QuickBMS</a>. This only supports <code>*.NXG_TEXTURES</code> files at the moment, which have to be extracted from the <code>GAME*.dat</code> files first.

## Tested with the following games:

- Currently only tested against *LEGOÂ® City Undercover*

I will test the program with more games in the near future.

## Planned features

- [ ] Extract file names from files as well (currently names the files after their offsets).
- [ ] Better reverse-engineer `*.NXG_TEXTURES` format (currently just searches for DDS file headers)
